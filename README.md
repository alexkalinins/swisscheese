# Swiss Cheese

This is a game in which a player has to find a way out of a proceduraly generated maze. The maze is generated through the Randomized Depth First Search algorithm. Once complete, the graphics will be rendered and displayed using a raycasting engine, similar to classics like "Wolfenstein 3D". The maze is generated with Java's SecureRandom, meaning that every maze is truly random and unique.
